# About "ai-search"

This is a frontend project build for Neural-Search-Engine for MVP's Demo onlhy

This project is my first React Project which is under the guidence of Brian Holt's React V6 course from [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/)

[Here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v6/) is Brian Holt's React course blog.

# React Configuration

## JavaScript Tools

1. NPM Configuration

   `cd ~/neural-search-engine/ai-search`

   `npm init -y`

   Now there is _package.json_, which is a manifest for the React project

2. Prettier (code formater for JavaScript)

- Install Prettier

  `npm install -D prettier`

  `-D` means that it's a dev dependency, I dont need to ship _Prettier_ to productiton

  You should check _package-lock.json_ file, **but never modify it by hand**

- Edit `.prettierrc`

  create `.prettierrc` under project root folder

  here you can define _two spaces_ vs _four spaces_; Please use _tabs_; please use _single quotes_ or _double quotes_

- Edit `package.json`
